  In November 2025, I began my PhD in Mathematics at the 
  <a href="https://www.dipmat.unisa.it/">Department of Mathematics</a> at the 
  <a href="https://web.unisa.it/">University of Salerno</a> under the supervision of 
  <a href="http://www.dipmat2.unisa.it/people/vitagliano/www/">Luca Vitagliano</a>.<br>
  &emsp; My research interests include, but are not limited to, smooth $G$-structures, Lie groupoids, differentiable stacks, and their relations to Poisson and symplectic geometry. Additionally, I am interested in applications of differential geometric structures in mathematical physics.
