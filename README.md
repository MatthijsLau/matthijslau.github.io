In November 2025, I began my PhD in Mathematics at the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.dipmat.unisa.it/) at the [University of Salerno](https://web.unisa.it/) under the supervision of [Luca Vitagliano](http://www.dipmat2.unisa.it/people/vitagliano/www/).  
  &emsp; My research interests include, but are not limited to, \(G\)-structures, Lie groupoids, and differentiable stacks. Additionally, I am interested in applications of geometry in mathematical physics.

2023-2025: M.Sc. in Mathematics, specialising in Mathematical Physics, at Radboud University Nijmegen.  
  &emsp; *Thesis*: <a href="{{ site.url }}/files/MT/MT.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fibred Lie groupoids and multiplicative connections</a>, supervised by [Ioan Mărcuț](https://sites.google.com/view/marcut).

2019-2023: B.Sc in Mathematics, and B.Sc in Physics at Radboud University Nijmegen.  
  &emsp; *Thesis*: <a href="{{ site.url }}/files/BT/BT.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Symplectic geometry: Darboux' theorem and Hamiltonian systems</a>, supervised by [Ioan Mărcuț](https://sites.google.com/view/marcut).
