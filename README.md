*my full CV is available <a href="{{ site.url }}/files/CV.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>*

In November 2025, I began my PhD in Mathematics at the Department of Mathematics at the University of Salerno under the supervision of [Luca Vitagliano](http://www.dipmat2.unisa.it/people/vitagliano/www/).  
  &emsp; My research interests include, but are not limited to, \(G\)-structures, Lie groupoids, and differentiable stacks. Additionally, I am interested in applications of geometry in mathematical physics.

2023-2025: M.Sc. in Mathematics, specialising in Mathematical Physics, at Radboud University Nijmegen.  
  &emsp; *Thesis*: Fibred Lie groupoids and multiplicative connections, supervised by [Ioan Mărcuț](https://sites.google.com/view/marcut).

2019-2023: B.Sc in Mathematics, and B.Sc in Physics at Radboud University Nijmegen.  
  &emsp; *Thesis*: Symplectic geometry: Darboux' theorem and Hamiltonian systems, supervised by [Ioan Mărcuț](https://sites.google.com/view/marcut).
