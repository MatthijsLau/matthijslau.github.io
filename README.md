Here is a small excerpt about me.  
*my full CV is available <a href="{{ site.url }}/files/CV.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>*<img scr = "https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f04c6ec-7fa7-4fe9-9752-14c74fb85624" width = 40>


In November 2025, I began my PhD in Mathematics at the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.dipmat.unisa.it/) at the [University of Salerno](https://web.unisa.it/) under the supervision of [Luca Vitagliano](http://www.dipmat2.unisa.it/people/vitagliano/www/).
  &emsp; My research interests include, but are not limited to, smooth $G$-structures, Lie groupoids, differentiable stacks, and their relations to Poisson and symplectic geometry. Additionally, I am interested in applications of differential geometric structures in mathematical physics.

2023-2025: M.Sc. in Mathematics, specialising in Mathematical Physics, at Radboud University Nijmegen (The Netherlands).
