\chapter{Classical Mechanics as a Physicist}
In the previous chapters, we discussed abstract geometrical objects called symplectic manifolds. From this point forward, we will turn towards an application: classical physics. Using symplectic geometry we can build a formal theory of classical mechanics, namely Hamiltonian mechanics. As many mathematicians may not be familiar with the contemporary formulations of classical mechanics past Newton's formalism, we will first dedicate a chapter to introducing physics to showcase the heuristic approach and create some intuition behind the methods. To do this we will discuss three formalisms: Newtonian, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian. Each of these formalisms is based on different principles, resulting in different methods of solving mechanical systems. For anyone familiar with these descriptions of physics, this chapter can easily be skipped without any continuity problems. This chapter is a combination of \cite{Taylor2005} and \cite{Arnold2006}. The translation of classical mechanics to symplectic geometry will be dealt with in Chapter~\ref{chp: hamiltonian systems}.
