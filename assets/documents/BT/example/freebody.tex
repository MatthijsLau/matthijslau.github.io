	Let us consider a free particle of mass \(m\) moving through three-dimensional space. The configuration space is \(\R[3]\) and the phase space is the cotangent bundle with the canonical symplectic form \(\h{\rcotang[3],\omega_{\can}}\). In the global coordinates generated by the global chart on \(\R[3]\) we can write the Lagrangian as
	\begin{equation*}
		\lag\h{x,\dot{x}} = \dfrac{1}{2}m\sum_i\dot{x}_i^2.
	\end{equation*}
	To transform this into a Hamiltonian, we first determine the generalised momenta of the Lagrangian.
	\begin{equation*}
		p_i = \pdv{\lag}{\dot{x}_i}\h{x,\dot{x}} = m\dot{x}_i.
	\end{equation*}
	Hence, we can derive the Hamiltonian for this system using the Legendre transform
	\begin{equation*}\label{eq: hamiltonian free particle}
		\ham\h{x,p} = \sum_i\dot{x}_ip_i - \lag\h{x,\dot{x}} = \dfrac{1}{2m}\sum_ip_i^2.
	\end{equation*}
	The Hamiltonian vector field is then given by 
	\begin{equation*}
		X_{\ham} = \sum_i\dfrac{p_i}{m}\pdv{q_i}.
	\end{equation*}
	The trajectories of the system are then the flow of the Hamiltonian phase flow. As the Hamiltonian phase flow is linear we find that the trajectories are as expected
	\begin{equation*}
		\flow[X_{\ham}]\h{\h{q,p},t} = \h{q + \flatfrac{pt}{m},p}.
	\end{equation*}
