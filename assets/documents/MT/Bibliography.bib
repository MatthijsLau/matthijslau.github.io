We also prove analogues of the Bianchi identities. In particular, we develop a cohomology theory which measures the existence of connections and curvings for G-gerbes over stacks. We also introduce G-central extensions of groupoids, generalizing the standard groupoid S1-central extensions. As an example, we apply our theory to study the differential geometry of G-gerbes over a manifold.},
