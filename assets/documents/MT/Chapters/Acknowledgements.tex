\section*{Acknowledgements}
\setcounter{page}{1}
I would like to thank Ioan M\u{a}rcu\c{t}, my daily supervisor, for all our long talks and discussions about the many thoughts we had on the topic. In particular, I am thankful for his constant inspiration and insight, leading to a final project quite different from what we had in mind at the start. Additionally, I want to thank him for his extra efforts in connecting me with many mathematicians as well. I also want to thank Walter van Suijlekom for taking the time to be my first reader and answering many noncommutative geometry-related questions on Lie groupoids. Lastly, a big thanks to \v{Z}an Grad for his guidance during the last year and for making me feel welcome and included in the world of maths.

I also want to thank Rozemarijn for her everlasting support and for listening to all my mathematical rambles over the past years, and helping me slow down at times. Furthermore, many thanks to my friends and especially my colleagues in the Master's room for the great last year and all the support during our many hours spent at the university. Lastly, I want to thank my family, of course, for the motivation and confidence.
